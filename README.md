# **HC-XAI-inventory**
---
This **inventory** includes a collection of human-centred tools you can use to evaluate the AI explanations. Some of the tools could also be used during the co-creation and development of the explanations. To ensure our inventory grows and is up to date, we invite the community to contribute to our collection. 

**How can you contribute?**

1. Download the template from the repository: https://github.com/smit-xai/smit-xai.github.io/blob/main/method%20card_template.docx
2. Add the existing method according to the criteria in the table. 
3. Upload the complete card to the repository as : [NAME OF THE METHOD_DD/MM/YYYY].docx
4. We will check the method card subsequently and add it to our collection. 


We refer you to our website for further information about the methods and the existing collection: https://data-en-maatschappij.ai/en/tools/tool-hc-xai-evaluation-inventory#chapter-2-what-kind-of-explanations-do-you-evaluate
